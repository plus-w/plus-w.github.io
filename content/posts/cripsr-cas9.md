## 1. Background

One of my recent works is related to design new Cas9 proteins to improve gene editing tools with machine learning. For people who has no idea what the CRISPR/Cas9 system is, it's a type of gene editor which has great potential to fix genetic errors that causes many many diseases in our body. *CRISPR* means **C**lustered **R**egularly **I**nterspaced **S**hort **P**alindromic **R**epeats, *Cas9* means **C**RISPR-**as**sociated protein **9**.

For people in CS background (like me), it might take much time to understand how the CRISPR/Cas9 system works because of those unfamiliar technical terms in biology field. Of course you can ask GPT to explain everything, but for myself, I think it's necessary to log these information based on my own understanding. This post makes a brief introudction to the structure and mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9 system. I'm not sure if my understanding is fully correct, you're welcome to point out any misunderstanding or misuse of word.
